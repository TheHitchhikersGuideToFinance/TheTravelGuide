Options can be a confusing and overwhelming subject to both new and experienced investors.

In this section, we will explain the basics of what options are, how option contracts work, the difference between Calls and Puts, provide an overview of different option trading strategies, and go further in depth to explain what it means when traders refer to "The Greeks"

By the end of this section, you should feel confident in your knowledge of the general principles of option contracts. It should be noted, however, that this is for educational purposes only, and should not be taken as investment advice. Trading options, especially when using advanced strategies, carries significant risk, and you should not trade options without speaking to a professional financial advisor to fully understand what these risks are.
