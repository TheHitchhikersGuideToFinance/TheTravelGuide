Automated trading based on rules that are derived from technical analysis
(creating a trading bot) is not a novel concept but traditionally has not been
available to the average investor. With cryptocurrency however, this concept
is more widely available through Application Programming Interfaces
([APIs](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/)) and tools such
as [Cryptohopper](https://www.cryptohopper.com/) and [3Commas](https://3commas.io/).
