The Hitchhikers Guide to Finance is a free and open source website that was created
as a complication of knowledge, educational sources, and resources for those
who wish to learn more about finance. The pages are intended to provide detailed
information that is easily digestible.

While this guide was inspired from the GameStop 2021 situation, it is not
 restricted to it! If you can [contribute](/help_build_the_community/edit_with_web_browser/), please do!

 Also, reading through in [this voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_7pEVPvuug) helps immensely.
