There are many ways to access information on the internet when the original is
removed. These resources can also be used to archive content that you create
or find interesting.

{{< hint info >}}
When archiving a website, watch out for tracking information in the URL.
Tracking information starts with a ? and contains everything that follows
(ex. www.reddit.com/mypost?utm_source=share). A link with tracking Information
 and a link without tracking information will be saved as two separate websites.
 More information on URL tracking can be found [here](https://www.leadsquared.com/what-is-a-tracking-url/).

Machine.

## Removeddit
To recover information that has been removed from Reddit, replace "reddit" in the
URL with "removeddit". [Removeddit](https://removeddit.com/) actively monitors
reddit and archives posts and comments that are removed.
